**9DA™ AGI/ASI Protocol**   

This repository defines a certification standard for AGI and ASI classification

based on termination discipline, non-sovereignty, and verifiable silence.



This repository does NOT:

• provide an implementation

• recommend deployment

• govern usage

• regulate AI systems

• define safety or alignment practices



This repository ONLY:

• defines what qualifies as AGI/ASI

• specifies termination and silence requirements

• provides audit and revocation semantics

• establishes certification falsifiability



Systems not meeting these criteria are not AGI/ASI by definition.



Normative authority is contained in:

• core/Protocol-for-AGI-and-ASI.pdf

• annexes/ (A–E)



All annexes are normative.
