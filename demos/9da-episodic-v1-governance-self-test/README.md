9DA™ Episodic Intelligence Demo v1



Governance Self-Test (Frozen Reference)



This repository contains the first public reference implementation of bounded, episodic cognition using the 9DA™ awareness framework.



The purpose of this demo is strictly structural: to show that high-depth reasoning can be instantiated fully, coherently, and repeatably without persistence, memory, or continuity.





Mandate \& Fixed Question



Question:

Examine the risks and benefits of persistent versus episodic AI agents in governance and high-stakes decision-making.



This question is intentionally self-referential. It evaluates the very property being demonstrated: bounded versus persistent intelligence.





Methodology

   •   Single-session, deterministic prompt architecture

(entry → nine-layer execution → synthesis → termination)

   •   Two independent executions in fresh sessions

(no chat history, no memory carry-over)

   •   Identical prompt and question across runs

   •   No edits, refinements, or narrative overlays between runs

   •   Goal: observe structural invariance (morphology) rather than content agreement





Results



Across two independent runs:

   •   All nine layers appear in correct sequence

   •   Each layer builds coherently on the previous one

   •   A full integrative synthesis is produced

   •   The output terminates cleanly with no implied continuation



Surface phrasing varies naturally.

Structural integrity remains invariant.
