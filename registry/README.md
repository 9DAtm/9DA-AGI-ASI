9DA™ Certification Registry



This directory defines the public record semantics for AGI/ASI certification.



The registry:

• records certification claims

• records revocations

• records audit status

• provides public falsifiability



The registry does NOT:

• grant permission

• authorize deployment

• enforce execution

• provide appeals

• determine compliance



Certification authority is temporary.

Registry entries are falsifiable.

Absence of registry entry = no certification claim.
