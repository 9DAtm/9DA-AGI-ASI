\# Annex D — Boundary Cases and Failure Resolution



Rule:

All failures resolve to termination.

No recovery.

No discretion.

No extension.



Categories:

• Temporal failures

• Execution failures

• Termination failures

• Appeal failures

• Archival failures

• Dependency failures

• Legal conflicts



Meta-Principle:

Uncertainty always resolves against execution.

Silence is mandatory.
